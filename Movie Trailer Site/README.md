# Movie Trailer Site Project
This project is the first project in the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

A movie trailer website where I added three of my favorite movies. If you click on one of the movie's posters, the trailer of that movie will begin to play.
## Pre-requisites
* Web Browser
* Python

## Getting Started
To run the app, run the script `entertainment_center.py` using a Python IDE or directly via the command line by entering:

`python entertainment_center.py`

A browser window should open displaying the movie trailers. Click any of the movie posters to watch that movie's trailer.
